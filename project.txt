Project: Audio Transcription and Summarization Chrome Extension

Architecture:
1. Chrome Extension - Handles audio recording and transcription.
2. Backend API - Processes transcriptions with ChatGPT instances, organizes and stores summaries in a database.
3. UI Webpage - Manages the extension's output and provides an interface for users.

Work Plan:

1. Develop the Chrome extension:
   a. Create a manifest file and basic structure.
   b. Implement an audio recording function using Web Audio API.
   c. Implement a transcription function using a speech-to-text service (Whisper API).

2. Develop the Backend API:
   a. Set up the server using the chosen technology stack.
   b. Create endpoints for receiving transcriptions, processing them with ChatGPT instances, and storing the summaries in the database.
   c. Implement a function to process transcriptions with ChatGPT instances and summarize the text.
   d. Implement a function to organize and store the summaries in a database (e.g. MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
   e. Implement authentication and authorization for secure API access.
   f. Create additional endpoints for managing summaries (e.g., retrieving, updating, deleting).

3. Develop the UI Webpage:
   a. Design the layout and user interface
   b. Implement a function to communicate with the Backend API for managing summaries.
   c. Implement components for displaying and managing summaries.
   d. Implement a login system for secure access.

4. Integrate the Chrome extension, Backend API, and UI Webpage:
   a. Connect the Chrome extension to the Backend API for processing transcriptions and handling summaries.
   b. Connect the UI Webpage to the Backend API for managing summaries and extension settings.
   c. Ensure seamless communication between all components.

Technical Details:
- Chrome Extension: JavaScript, Web Audio API, Whisper API (for speech-to-text)
- Backend API: Node.js/Express, ChatGPT API, MongoDB/PostgreSQL (for database)
- UI Webpage: React or Angular for frontend, UI design tools (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD)

Remember to update the project.txt file with any changes, progress, or new technical details as the project evolves.
