Project: Audio Transcription and Summarization Chrome Extension

Architecture:
1. Chrome Extension - Handles audio recording and transcription.
2. Backend API - Processes transcriptions with ChatGPT instances, organizes and stores summaries in a database.
3. UI Webpage - Manages the extension's output and provides an interface for users.

Work Plan:

1. Develop the Chrome extension:
   a. Create a manifest file and basic structure.
   b. Implement an audio recording function using Web Audio API.
   c. Implement a transcription function using a speech-to-text service (Whisper API).

2. Develop the Backend API:
   a. Set up the server using the chosen technology stack.
   b. Create endpoints for receiving transcriptions, processing them with ChatGPT instances, and storing the summaries in the database.
   c. Implement a function to process transcriptions with ChatGPT instances and summarize the text.
   d. Implement a function to organize and store the summaries in a database (e.g. MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
   e. Implement authentication and authorization for secure API access.
   f. Create additional endpoints for managing summaries (e.g., retrieving, updating, deleting).

3. Develop the UI Webpage:
   a. Design the layout and user interface
